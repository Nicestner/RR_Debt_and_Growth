In their paper “Growth in a Time of Debt”, Reinhart & Rogoff (2010) analyse a historical cross-country 
dataset of 20 advanced economies (RR) on public debt/GDP ratio, real GDP growth and inflation to find 
correlations  between  the variables. 

Reinhart &  Rogoff conclude  that  countries experience  significantly  lower  real GDP  growth  across  all 
countries. A rise of inflation rates when public debt is high can only be observed in emerging markets. 
The publication was criticised by Herndon, Ash and Pollin (2013), who pointed out both arithmetical 
and systematic errors.
